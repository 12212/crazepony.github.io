      <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p><i class="fa fa-tags"></i>&nbsp;Before applying power, pay attention to the battery voltage selection. The default shipping is 1S (4.2V); 2S first need to disconnect the short contacts 1S, 2S and then connect two pads short. Prohibit the same three pads shorted together.
        <p><i class="fa fa-tags"></i>&nbsp;Receiver configuration</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PPM and SBUS receiver welded to the UART2 GND, + 5V, RX2 above, SBUS signal CF in the software configuration</li>
            <li>DSM DSM receiver soldered directly to the interface 3.3V, GND, RX3, CF the software configuration UART3. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p>Due to the overwhelming response from the customers, we have put together this FAQ to answer the most commonly asked questions.This section will grow as more and more members of the customers give us valuable feeedback and suggestions on how to improve the tune.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Can it handle 2S batteries?</p>
        <p>Yes,it supports 2s lipo battery,which could give you even more fierce racing experience than 1s.Bridge these two pins to support 2s battery as show below.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/f3-brushed-1s-2s.jpg" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Can it handle 8.5mm high-speed motors?</p>
        <p>Yes, the board can run 8.5mm motors.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>What Flight Modes does it have?</p>
        <p>The board runs the popular Cleanflight/Betaflight firmware that is fully customizable and includes several different modes: Auto-Level, Horizon (auto-leveling mode with ability to flip), and full manual (rate). You can also enable AirMode and be able to control the quad at any speed and attitude</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>What is the size of the motor micro JST plugs?</p>
        <p>The board uses the JST 1.25 2 pin style plug</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Does it have Altitude Hold?</p>
        <p>No, we are focused on making this board the lightest and most agile that it  can be, and are excluding extra features such as altitude hold for the time being.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Any experience loading Betaflight onto it?</p>
        <p>You could follower this <a href="https://github.com/Crazepony/others/blob/master/How%20to%20Flash%20Firmware%20for%20F3%20EVO%20Flight%20Controller.pdf" target="_blank">user manual</a> to flash Beraflight firmware to the fc.This is the stardand process to flash F3 EVO fc.The followring image shows the Newest BF firmware we tested.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/f3-brushed-betaflight-3.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>After the Betaflight firmware is flashed successfully,you need a little bit setup.</p>
        <p>If the version of Betaflight you have is 3.0 or above,change ESC/Motor protocol to BRUSHED on the Configuration Tab.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/f3-brushed-betaflight-1.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>If the version of Betaflight you have is 2.9.1,set ESC/Motor protocol to PWM on the Configuration Tab</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/f3-brushed-betaflight-2.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>For all these firmwares,you need to go to CLI and type this in</p>
        <pre>set motor_pwm_rate=4000
save</pre>
