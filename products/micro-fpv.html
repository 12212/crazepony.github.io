        <h3>Binding & Flying Procedure</h3>
        <p>a.Turn on transmitter, create new mode setup(modified original setup created before also available ), the Mode must be D8, turn off after setup.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/micro-fpv-frsky-1.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>b. Power on quadcopter, red LED flashing rapodly on receiver after 6 seconds, the receiver is ready for binding. Then turn on the transmitter, enter the binding mode, the Red LED will be solid, means binded successfully with default mode SBUS.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Turn on the transmitter between 6 to 30 second to binded with SBUS mode; Turn on the transmitter after 30 seconds to binded with PPM mode. Flight controller default SBUS mode.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/micro-fpv-frsky-2.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>c. Each flight, turn on the transmitter firstly, then power on the quadcopter, the receiver Red LED solid, means binded, with RSSI and voltage return.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/micro-fpv-frsky-3.png" alt="Components" class="img-responsive"></p>
        <p>d. Switch SA key(middle position ), the Blue LED light on the receiver, means quadcopter unlocked and ready to fly.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p>Due to the overwhelming response from the customers, we have put together this FAQ to answer the most commonly asked questions.This section will grow as more and more members of the customers give us valuable feeedback and suggestions on how to improve the tune.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Can i enjoy it if i am a drone hobby beginner?</p>
        <p>Its not a beginners quad.You will need a descent transmitter.</p>
        <p>You will need to know how to program cleanflight/betaflight.</p>
        <p>Most important,you should have 5.8G goggles to enjoy the FPV experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>can we buy the receiver separately?or replace it.</p>
        <p>The receiver is connected to the fc board with 3 wires (PPM/5V/GND).Unsolder them and solder in your preferred micro receiver.For example,receiver can be replaced with a Spektrum DSMX Satt.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>How to bind the FrSky X9D transmitter?</p>
        <p>Bind process(S-BUS output): shut down your FrSky X9D transmitter,power on receiver.It goes into binding state 6 seconds later with LED flashing.Then power on the transmitter and start its bind function.When the LED is solid on,binding success.</p>
        <p>Bind process(CPPM output): shut down your FrSky X9D transmitter,power on receiver.It goes into binding state 6 seconds later with LED flashing.Wait for 30 seconds.Then power on the transmitter and start its bind function.When the LED is flashing every second,binding success.</p>
        <p>You need to bind the receiver with your transmitter the first time.When using later,you MUST power on you transmitter before power on the receiver.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>I want more information about the brush flight controller.</p>
        <p>The FC is designed by Makerfire team.It is based on SPRacing F3_EVO_Brush FC,full Cleanflight/Betaflight compatibility on a STM32 F303 style processor.The size is 26mm x 26mm, fully compatible with the Blade Inductrix quad frame and mounting pattern.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Hello, has the item already comes with engines, control board and the camera of fpv?</p>
        <p>Yes, it comes with 4*720 coreless motors, F3 brushed flight control board and 40CH AIO camera of FPV.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Does it have race band?</p>
        <p>Yes, this BNF kit contain AIO camera and work with 40CH, which includes 8CH race band.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Does it include motor plug ends jst 1.25mm 2 pin micro?</p>
        <p>Yes, motor plug ends jst 1.25 2 pin micro with 7mm*20mm dimension.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong>Is this a complete rtf quad and does it include a battery?</p>
        <p>This is not complete RTF drone. You need a transmitter to bind to it. FrSky Taranis X9D is recommended. A 200mAh battery is included, with a JST connector for Blade Inductrix TINY WHOOP drone racing.</p>
